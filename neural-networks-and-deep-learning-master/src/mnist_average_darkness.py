"""
mnist_average_darkness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A naive classifier for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST
data set.  The program classifies digits based on how dark they are
--- the idea is that digits like "1" tend to be less dark than digits
like "8", simply because the latter has a more complex shape.  When
shown an image the classifier returns whichever digit in the training
data had the closest average darkness.

The program works in two steps: first it trains the classifier, and
then it applies the classifier to the MNIST test data to see how many
digits are correctly classified.

Needless to say, this isn't a very good way of recognizing handwritten
digits!  Still, it's useful to show what sort of performance we get
from naive ideas."""
